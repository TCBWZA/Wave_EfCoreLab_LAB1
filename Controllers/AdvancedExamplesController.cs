        /// Demonstrates executing raw SQL when LINQ is too complex or inefficient.
        /// 
        /// When to use Raw SQL:
        /// - Complex queries that are hard/impossible in LINQ
        /// - Performance optimization (LINQ generates suboptimal SQL)
        /// - Database-specific features (window functions, CTEs, etc.)
        /// - Stored procedures
        /// - Bulk operations
        /// 
        /// FromSqlRaw vs FromSqlInterpolated:
        /// 
        /// FromSqlRaw (this example):
        /// - Uses numbered parameters: {0}, {1}, {2}
        /// - Must manually specify parameters
        /// - Example: FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Id = {0}", id)
        /// 
        /// FromSqlInterpolated (recommended):
        /// - Uses string interpolation: $"... {variable} ..."
        /// - Automatically parameterized (SQL injection safe)
        /// - Example: FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Id = {id}")
        /// 
        /// IMPORTANT Security Notes:
        /// 1. NEVER concatenate user input into SQL strings
        ///    BAD:  $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = '{userInput}'"  // SQL injection!
        ///    GOOD: FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = {userInput}")
        /// 
        /// 2. Always use parameterized queries
        ///    EF automatically parameterizes FromSqlInterpolated
        /// 
        /// 3. Be cautious with FromSqlRaw - easy to make mistakes
        /// 
        /// Limitations:
        /// - Query must return all columns of entity
        /// - Can't use for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (use ExecuteSqlRaw for that)
        /// - Still returns tracked entities (unless combined with AsNoTracking)
